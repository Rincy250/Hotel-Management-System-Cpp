Hotel Management System in C++
=============================

This C++ project presents a comprehensive Hotel Management System, offering a console-based interface to manage various aspects of a hotel, including room reservations, guest interactions, billing, staff management, and more. The system is designed using object-oriented programming principles, showcasing C++ language features and best practices.

Key Features:
- View and manage available rooms, their types, and features.
- Book and check-out rooms for guests, calculating bills and managing reservations.
- Interact with restaurant services, place orders, and calculate bills.
- Manage a diverse workforce of employees, each with their respective roles and responsibilities.
- Efficiently handle guest and employee details, including Aadhar validation.
- Utilize inheritance and polymorphism to create room and employee hierarchies.
- Incorporate exception handling for robust input validation.
- Demonstrate clean code practices, encapsulation, and resource management.

This project serves as both a functional Hotel Management System and an educational resource for learning C++ programming techniques. It includes classes for rooms, guests, employees, reservations, billing, and more, showcasing real-world scenarios that hotel systems encounter.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project to enhance your C++ skills and create your own unique hotel management solutions. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
